// The gate reads LABELS, not answers. `Final Answer` / `Guessed Answer` are the
// contract's FIXED vocabulary — the one part of a deliverable a pattern can match
// without betting on the model's phrasing — and one pattern serves both, because
// everything around the words varies (heading marks, blockquote, bullets, emphasis,
// backticks, quotes, ASCII and full-width colons, any whitespace) and is therefore
// stripped by class instead of enumerated.
//
// What the value SAYS is answer_auditor's judgement: which text is the value, whether
// it is grounded in the evidence, whether a rival is a real tie, whether a line merely
// cites a document. The auditor reads the deliverable and the cited chunks with a
// model, and its contract already carries every one of those defects. The gate used to
// duplicate four of them as text heuristics, and each was a bet on phrasing that lost:
// the value reader alone needed five patterns as five shapes appeared in real runs
// (value on the next line, whole-line bold, separately bolded label, notes citing
// documents in parentheses, CJK punctuation), and a miss read a well-formed delivery as
// value-less — skipping the checks built on it and buying a repair turn (measured on
// q775 and twice on q283).
// The contract's label is the phrase `Final Answer` / `Guessed Answer`, and the
// gate asks exactly ONE question about a deliverable: does that phrase occur?
// Nothing else about the text is read - not the emphasis markers, not the
// parentheses, not the colons, not a `tie` clause - so the pattern is the phrase
// itself, anchored to nothing. The `\b` after `answer` keeps the plural
// (`Final Answers`, in prose) from reading as a label; everything past the phrase
// belongs to the auditor.
