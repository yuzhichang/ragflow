// Survivors chain integrity: the mechanical half of the "look ahead, then
// come back" discipline. Only the ORDER half is enforced here. An earlier
// version also refused an answer filler that traced to no upstream Survivors
// set ("entered from outside the run"); #42 measured that as a false-positive
// generator - a property-type answer (the institution where a person died)
// legitimately names a value that is a PROPERTY of the upstream entity and
// never a member of any Survivors set, so the check refused correct
// deliverables ten passes in a row and burned the audit budget. The
// chain-outside-answer defect that motivated it is caught by the order rule
// itself (the measured case had the downstream filled over an empty
// upstream), so the provenance half is gone.
//
// A Survivors line is a structural artifact - a variable, a set - and the
// plan's `From` edges are structural facts the stage-one check already
// verified. That makes chain order machine-checkable in a way evidence
// quality is not: a downstream variable standing on an empty upstream slot is
// a fact about two sets, not a reading of prose, so the gate enforces it
// itself instead of asking the auditor to notice (the auditor's contract
// grades survivor opinions advisory, and #38-#40 measured the result: a
// deliverable whose ?answer read "Michael Jordan" while the ?attendee slot it
// depended on read empty). Refusing here, before the audit, buys the repair
// turn the discipline needs: the producer must go back and establish the
// empty upstream block, exactly what the doctrine's chain-order rule demands.
//
// Tolerance is deliberate: a deliverable with no Survivors line, or a plan
// that parses to no blocks, yields no findings - this check adds a refusal
// reason, it does not become a new way for a malformed run to fail.
