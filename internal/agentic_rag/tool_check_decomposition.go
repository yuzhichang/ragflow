//
// Why it is code and not one more audit opinion: across the archived runs the
// auditor diagnosed these shape defects only partially (in one run a reserved
// name bound by two blocks went unreported while thirty field-integrity findings
// crowded the same verdict), and no run ever repaired one (q875 spent six audit
// rounds on a shape
// defect and shipped anyway). Every check below is a membership test over header
// text, so it holds whatever the wording - the property the gate's own note
// demands of anything that carries an opinion.
//
// The findings reuse the auditor's own fail strings verbatim, so a finding here
// is a finding there; where the auditor's string carries no locator, the locator
// is appended in parentheses so the audited prefix is still a substring of it.

const checkDecompositionToolDescription = `Mechanically checks a DRAFT decomposition (the block plan, written before any search) and returns the structural findings it contains. It reads the plan's header fields only - variables, edges, constraint numbers - and every check below is a membership or counting test over them, so it holds whatever the wording.

The checks:
1. Block shape: every block carries, directly under its ` + "`### Sub-question N:`" + ` heading, a ` + "`slot:`" + ` tag from the closed list (name / literal / number / quantity / date / set), a ` + "`- Op:`" + ` line, a ` + "`- Binds: ?variable`" + ` line, and a ` + "`- Constraints:`" + ` line of ` + "`c<k> = <claim>`" + ` definitions separated by ";" - a missing field, an unknown slot type, or text trailing the last definition on the Constraints line is a finding.
2. Variables: names are unique plan-wide; ` + "`?answer`" + ` is bound by exactly ONE block, the one that fills the asked slot.
3. Edges: every ` + "`From:`" + ` variable is bound somewhere; each entry carries its ` + "`(block N)`" + ` pointer and the pointer names the block that binds it; a "follow" block must have a bound input.
4. Graph (a STRICT DAG): ` + "`From: none`" + ` marks a root, and a root whose variable no other block consumes is a second, disconnected question; the graph must be acyclic, and every block must reach the ` + "`?answer`" + ` block - each block's value consumed, transitively, by the block that binds ` + "`?answer`" + ` - so an orphan, a dead-end side branch, or a block consuming ` + "`?answer`" + ` itself is a finding.
5. Boundary: only a ` + "`?variable`" + ` crosses a block boundary - a block number ("block 1") or a prose reference ("the above") inside a title or a constraint is a finding.
6. Titles: every title names a ` + "`?variable`" + ` (its own block's, or one it consumes), and the upstream variables the title references are EXACTLY the ones its constraints reference - a variable the title carries but no constraint tests is asserted without being verified, and a variable the constraints test but the title omits is a dependency hidden from the reader; a title with no variable at all names no anchor.
7. Constraint numbers: the ` + "`c<k>`" + ` numbers are a partition - a number defined by two blocks, or reused for a different claim, is a finding.
8. Constraint form: every constraint uses its own block's variable plus zero or more of the variables its ` + "`From:`" + ` declares - nothing else - so the claim is a proposition one chunk can confirm or refute on its own.
9. ` + "`From:`" + ` faithfulness: the declared set is EXACTLY the upstream variables the constraints use - an undeclared reference and an unused declaration are both findings.

Two sizes are HINTS on the output, never findings - invitations to keep editing the plan rather than verdicts: a plan of ten or more blocks hints that some of them could share one block (merge them), and a block of ten or more constraints hints that part of them settles its own variable with its own anchors (split it off). Two sizes are HARD CAPS and fail as findings: a plan of more than ten blocks, and a block of more than ten constraints. What is deliberately NOT checked, because it is a judgment about wording rather than a mechanical fact: whether a sub-question is EQUIVALENT to its constraint set, whether a title names a real anchor of the question, whether a value inlines another block's candidate - you make those when you draft the plan, and the auditor re-checks them on the delivery.

Call this IMMEDIATELY after writing the decomposition and BEFORE any retrieval: at that moment the plan is only these header lines, and a defect in it costs a whole run - a name bound twice voids every later reference to it, and a title that names no variable leaves every later reader guessing what the block holds.

Input:
- plan: the drafted decomposition exactly as it will appear in the matrix, with no evidence lines (no Searched/Tested/Eliminated/Retained/Derived/Failure).

It reports the same fail strings the answer auditor uses. Fix every finding, adjust for the hints you choose to act on, and call it again; the output NEVER comes back empty - the plan is ready for retrieval only when it starts with ` + "`OK`" + ` (an ` + "`OK`" + ` that carries planning hint(s) still passes: hints are suggestions, findings are not present).`
