// Served-unread watchdog: a document the retrieval keeps surfacing and the run
// never opens is a lead going to waste.
//
// The evidence for the mechanism is measured, not stylistic, and it is the same
// evidence that built the locate watchdog: the lead-consumption duty written
// into the system prompt produced zero read_search_ledger calls across three
// measured runs (#39 - 0 calls in every run, while one run burned seventeen
// semantic relation searches and still never opened the document the searches
// kept returning). A rule the model reads once at the top of a 30k-character
// prompt competes with everything else in it; a line attached to the tool
// result it is looking at does not.
//
// What it counts is leads, not activity: the tally is the served documents
// that accumulated at least servedUnreadWatchMinServes serve events and have
// never reached a deep read. A run that opens one of them has consumed the
// lead and hears nothing (and the reminder re-arms for the next batch); a run
// that keeps enumerating new candidates while the same documents pile up
// unheard hears the same short reminder naming them. One reminder per
// deep-read epoch - the reset is the cap.
