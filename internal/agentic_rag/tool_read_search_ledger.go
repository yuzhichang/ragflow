// readSearchLedgerTool exposes the run's append-only search ledger to the
// delivery gate's auditor. It answers one question with recorded facts instead
// of the deliverable's own reconstruction: WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SEARCHED.
//
// The Candidate Matrix's Searched lines are the explorer's end-of-run account
// of its behavior, and that account measurably underreports - a #30 run
// executed 59 distinct searches while its shipped matrix carried 8 Searched
// lines, which made a thoroughly-searched anchor read as "never queried" for
// five audit passes. Coverage judgements ("this clue anchor was never
// queried", "no co-occurrence scan ran", "the run opened on a guess") must
// therefore be verified against this ledger before they are asserted, and a
// matrix whose Searched lines omit ledger-recorded searches is itself a
// suspect.
//
// The ledger is append-only and ordered by execution: entry 1 is the run's
// actual first search, which is what the candidate-free opening rule is judged
// against. The optional `after` cursor returns only the delta - what the
// explorer did since the seq the auditor last read - so a re-audit after a
// repair turn can verify repair compliance directly.
