// Locate watchdog: the meaning-based leg is the one locate tool a run can hold
// and never reach for.
//
// The evidence for putting the nudge here rather than in the prompt is measured,
// not stylistic. The question of WHEN to use the semantic bridge was stated in
// four places in the system prompt (role list, retrieval step 2, convergence
// step 5, the output-format schema); it was rewritten into a countable trigger
// ("three lexical queries on one clue with no testable candidate") and
// re-measured on #221: two runs, zero bridge calls, both times. Across the whole
// history #221 used it 0 times in 6 runs, q350 1-5 times per run, and #71 once —
// after 16 lexical calls, at 46% of the run. A rule the model reads once at the
// top of a 30k-character prompt competes with everything else in it; a line
// attached to the tool result it is looking at does not.
//
// What it counts is progress, not activity: the tally is locate calls SINCE THE
// LAST DEEP READ, and list_chunks resets it. A run that searches three times and
// then reads a document has moved forward and hears nothing; a run that keeps
// re-wording without opening anything has not, and hears the same short reminder
// every Nth locate call. There is deliberately no cap on how often it can speak —
// the reset is the cap. A run that never reads is not "being nagged", it is stuck,
// and the reminder is the one thing in its context that says why.
