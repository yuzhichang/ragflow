# environment variables for --ws-auth/--ws-token-file (verified on 0.162.0). So we
# materialize the token from an env var into a private file and hand the app-server that
# path. The operator-facing interface stays env-driven, and the secret never appears on
# the command line (only the token *file* path does).
